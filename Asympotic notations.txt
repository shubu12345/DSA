Data Structure and Algorithm

	1. Array Traversal
	2. Array accessing
	3. Array Inserting
	4. Searching Array
	5. Deleting Array
	6. Merge Two Arrays
	
Time Complexity and Space Complexity -
Formula - f(n) = 5n2 + 6n + 12

What is Asympotic Analysis?
-> Asympotic analysis is used to analyze the problem and find which soultion is better for the given problems.

Example - 
If I have 1000 array of set then in this case linear search is the good approach.
If I have 1000000 array of set then in this case binary search is the good approach.

Array Sorting with Algorithm

1. Bubble Sorting -
example - 
data = [8,4,1,6,5,10];

// Bubble Sorting
step1- [4,8,1,5,6,10]
step2 - [4,1,5,6,10]
step3 = [4,1,5,6,10]
step4 = [1,4,5,6,10] - >sorted.
