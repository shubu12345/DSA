Data Structure and Algorithm

	1. Array Traversal
	2. Array accessing
	3. Array Inserting
	4. Searching Array
	5. Deleting Array
	6. Merge Two Arrays
	
Time Complexity and Space Complexity -
Formula - f(n) = 5n2 + 6n + 12

What is Asympotic Analysis?
-> Asympotic analysis is used to analyze the problem and find which soultion is better for the given problems.

Example - 
If I have 1000 array of set then in this case linear search is the good approach.
If I have 1000000 array of set then in this case binary search is the good approach.

Array Sorting with Algorithm

1. Bubble Sorting -
Bubble sorting is a sorting technique to sort an given array. it follows basic swaping operations to sort
an giveb element below is the example.
example - 
data = [8,4,1,6,5,10];

// Bubble Sorting
step1- [4,8,1,6,5,10] - first sort 4,8
step2- [4,8,1,6,5,10] - sort 1,6
step3- [4,8,1,5,6,10] - sort 6,5
step4- [4,8,1,5,6,10] - sort 6,10
step5- [4,1,8,5,6,10] - sort 8,1
step6- [4,1,5,8,6,10] - sort 8,5
step7- [4,1,5,6,8,10] - sort 8,6
step8- [4,1,5,6,8,10] - sort 8,10
step9- [1,4,5,6,8,10] - sort 4,1
step10- [1,4,5,6,8,10] - sorted return the array

//Head and tail need to study the conecpt from interview point
// recursion 
1. direct recursion
2. Indirect recursion


//Stack
stack is a liner data structure which as mainly two operations push and pop.
stack works on Last In First Out[LIFO] principle.

example -
consider the stack of below
push()
first inserted - 1
[1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5]
				last inserted - 5
pop()
				last removed - 1
[5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1]
first poped - 5

//Queue
Queue is a linear data structure which as follow basic Traversal to perform operation as mention below.
Queue workds on principle as First In First Out[FIFO].
1. Traversal can be basic.
2. data can be inserted from front and rear side. it means data can be inserted fron start and end both
ways.
